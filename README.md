# Discord Game Categories Bot (non-commercial)

This Discord community bot uses the RAWG API to:
- provide **game search/autocomplete** for slash commands,
- fetch **cover images/links** for professional-looking vote embeds.

Purpose: members propose new game categories; the bot shows an embed with cover art, vote buttons, and creates hidden category + role after the threshold. We respect RAWG rate limits and cache only minimal metadata (id, name, image url).
